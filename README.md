# Better-Physics

A mod for Clamb to improve the physics.

This mod changes the collision detection method for the player and hammer rigid bodies from discrete to continuous dynamic.
It also allows you to optionally change the default solver iterations and default solver velocity iterations for even better physics at the cost of performance.
Don't change these if you don't know what that means!
